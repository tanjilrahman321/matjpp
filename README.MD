## Getting Started

GitHub makes it easy to create personal websites. Follow this link - [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to know how or follow the steps below.

If you already have a GitHub profile (obviously)

* Create a new repo with the name `{username}.github.io`
* Clone/Fork this repo and copy the files to your newly created repo
* Customize your name, links and everything else for your landing page
* `git push`

Voila! Your site should be live at `https://{username}.github.io`

Here's my **Dev Landing Page** - [Helitha Rupasinghe | Polygot Dev](https://hr21don.github.io/)

### Custom Domain

If you want to make your new landing page available under a domain like `{username}.com` you can get started here - [Setting up a custom domain](https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/).
